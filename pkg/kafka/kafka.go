/*
Package kafka provides a simple high-level API for producing and consuming
Apache Kafka messages.

Based on github.com/segmentio/kafka-go, it abstracts away the complexities of
the Kafka protocol and provides a simplified interface for working with Kafka
topics.

It allows to specify custom message encoding and decoding functions, including
serialization and encryption.
