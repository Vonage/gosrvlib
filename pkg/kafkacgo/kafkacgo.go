/*
Package kafkacgo provides a simple high-level API for producing and consuming Apache Kafka messages.
It abstracts away the complexities of the Kafka protocol and provides a simplified interface for working with Kafka topics.

IMPORTANT: This package depends on a C implementation, CGO must be enabled to use this package.
For a non-CGO implementation see the "kafka" package.
